# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living space area, lot size, condition of the house, and more. By leveraging historical data, we build machine learning models to predict house prices accurately. The ultimate goal is to help individuals, real estate agents, and businesses make informed decisions when buying or selling homes.

## Project Description

This project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of houses and their sale prices. The goal is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting a house’s price based on its features. The data contains the following information about each house:

- Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms
- Square Foot of the Living Area and Lot Size
- Condition and View 
- Year Built and Year Renovated

By analyzing this data, we can build a model that predicts the sale price of a house. The machine learning model trained on this data can help individuals make smarter decisions in the housing market.

## Technologies Used

This project was implemented using the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used to create visualizations that help in understanding the data.
- **Plotly**: For interactive and engaging visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A powerful library used for implementing machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment used to run and present the analysis step-by-step.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   The dataset used for this project contains historical data of house sales. Each row represents a sale and includes several features about the house, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, the square footage of the living area, and more.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Before training the model, the data is cleaned and preprocessed:
   - Missing values are handled by filling them with appropriate values.
   - Categorical variables are converted into numerical values using encoding techniques.
   - Feature scaling is applied to ensure that features with different scales do not negatively impact the model.

3. **Model Training**:
   A machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest) is trained using the cleaned and preprocessed data. The model learns the relationships between the features of the houses and their corresponding prices.

4. **Prediction**:
   After training, the model is used to predict house prices based on the input features (e.g., number of bedrooms, square footage). The model’s accuracy is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.

## Results and Insights

Upon completing the model training, we evaluate its performance on a test dataset (houses not seen during training). The model's ability to predict the sale price of houses is measured using various metrics, including:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: A metric that calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual house prices.
- **R² Score**: A measure of how well the model’s predictions match the actual house prices. The closer the score is to 1, the better the model’s predictions.

### Key Insights:
- **Most Important Features**: Some features, like the square footage of the living area and the number of bedrooms, have a stronger impact on the price than others.
- **Predictions vs Actuals**: The predictions made by the model are close to the actual sale prices, but there may still be some variations, especially for houses with unusual features.
